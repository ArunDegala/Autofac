Autofac
=======

A GitHub clone of the excellent Autofac library on GoogleCode

_Every_ possible (read: reasonable) effort will be made to keep this repo up-to-date with the [Hg repo out on code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/autofac/).

Please note that only the "[default](http://code.google.com/p/autofac/source/list?name=default)" branch from the original source will make it into this repo; I don't have the bandwidth to track and merge every change from every branch over there.

Currently, my plan is to use [hg-git](http://hg-git.github.com/) to push the source repo's commits to this repo.

Feel free to send me pull requests; any changes that make it into master will be sent to the original authors @ GoogleCode as patches. Maybe our contributions can make it into the official build!

For those that live on the bleeding edge, I'll be pushing a Community.Autofac.* package series up to NuGet using this repo's code.

Please see [the original project](http://code.google.com/p/autofac/) for more info.
